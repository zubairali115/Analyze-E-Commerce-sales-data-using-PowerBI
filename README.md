# Analyze-E-Commerce-sales-data-using-PowerBI
This project involves building an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze the sales performance of an e-commerce store. 
The goal is to transform raw sales logs into actionable insights that help stakeholders understand revenue trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

Business Problem: The e-commerce manager needs to answer questions such as: "Which months had the highest sales?", "Who are our most valuable customers?", and "Which products are frequently returned?"

Key Metrics (KPIs) to Track:-

Total Revenue: The sum of all sales.
Total Profit: Revenue minus Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).
Total Quantity Sold: The number of units moved.
Average Order Value (AOV): Total Revenue / Total Orders.
Profit Margin: (Total Profit / Total Revenue) * 100.
